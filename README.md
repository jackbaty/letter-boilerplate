# Letter Boilerplate

A boilerplate to quickly and painlessly generate high-quality letters through LaTeX.

Why settle for MS Word when you can get the job done using your text editor?

Based on [letter-boilerplate](https://github.com/mrzool/letter-boilerplate) with the following
changes:

* No longer uses a separate details.yml file. I don't mind the configuration as frontmatter
of the Markdown letter file.
* Uses a centralized signature file rather than keeping copies of it for every letter
* The "letterhead" variable now expects a filename rather than true/false. This lets me 
easily pick from several letterhead files.
